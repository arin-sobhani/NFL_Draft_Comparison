## 🚀 How to Run

### Option 1: Web Application (Recommended)
```bash
./run_app.sh
```
This will install dependencies and start the Streamlit web app at `http://localhost:8501`

### Option 2: Command Line Interface
```bash
python3 cli_app.py
```

### Option 3: Manual Setup
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🏈 Features Implemented

### 1. **Player Database**
- 60+ NFL draft prospects from 2024
- 8 different positions (QB, WR, RB, TE, OT, EDGE, CB, S)
- Complete combine statistics for each player

### 2. **Smart Similarity Analysis**
- Position-specific weighting algorithm
- Machine learning-based similarity scoring
- Normalized statistical comparisons

### 3. **Interactive Web Interface**
- Modern, responsive design
- Position filtering
- Real-time similarity calculations
- Interactive visualizations (radar charts, bar graphs)
- AI-generated explanations

### 4. **Command Line Interface**
- Text-based interaction
- Same functionality as web app
- Detailed comparison tables

## 📊 Statistics Analyzed

The tool compares players across 8 key combine metrics:
- **Height** (inches)
- **Weight** (pounds) 
- **40-Yard Dash** (seconds)
- **Vertical Jump** (inches)
- **Broad Jump** (inches)
- **Bench Press** (reps)
- **Shuttle** (seconds)
- **3-Cone Drill** (seconds)

## 🧠 Algorithm Details

### Similarity Calculation Process:
1. **Feature Normalization**: All stats standardized using StandardScaler
2. **Position Weighting**: Different weights for different positions
3. **Distance Calculation**: Weighted Euclidean distance
4. **Similarity Scoring**: Converted to 0-1 similarity scale

### Position-Specific Weights:
- **QBs**: Emphasize mobility and speed
- **WRs**: Prioritize speed, jumping, explosiveness
- **RBs**: Focus on speed, strength, explosiveness
- **TEs**: Emphasize size, height, strength
- **OTs**: Prioritize size, weight, strength
- **EDGE**: Focus on speed, strength, size
- **DBs**: Emphasize speed, agility, jumping

## 🎨 User Interface Features

### Web Application:
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Position filtering and player selection
- **Player Cards**: Clean display of player information
- **Similarity Scores**: Visual similarity indicators
- **Interactive Charts**: Radar charts and bar graphs
- **Detailed Tables**: Side-by-side stat comparisons
- **AI Explanations**: Human-readable similarity explanations

### Command Line:
- **Menu-Driven Interface**: Easy navigation
- **Formatted Output**: Clean, readable results
- **Comparison Tables**: Detailed statistical comparisons

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test script to verify everything works:
```bash
python3 test_app.py
```

## 📈 Example Results

When comparing Caleb Williams (QB), the tool finds:
1. Spencer Rattler (QB) - Similarity: 0.437
2. Bo Nix (QB) - Similarity: 0.416  
3. Michael Penix Jr. (QB) - Similarity: 0.323

## 🔧 Technical Stack

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Streamlit** - Web framework
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation
- **NumPy** - Numerical computations
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning
- **Plotly** - Interactive visualizations

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **NFL Scouting**: Find players with similar athletic profiles
- **Draft Analysis**: Compare prospects to understand strengths
- **Player Development**: Study similar players' career paths
- **Fantasy Football**: Identify players with similar combine numbers

## 🚀 Next Steps

Potential enhancements:
- Add more historical draft classes
- Include college production statistics
- Add injury history and medical data
- Implement more sophisticated algorithms
- Add career outcome analysis
- Include team-specific scouting reports

## ✅ Project Status

**COMPLETE** ✅

The NFL Player Comparison Tool is fully functional and ready for use. It provides both web and command-line interfaces, comprehensive player analysis, and intelligent similarity matching based on position-specific criteria.
