# Cluster complete profiles into archetypes
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=8, random_state=42)
clusters = kmeans.fit_predict(complete_data_scaled)

# Assign incomplete players to nearest archetype
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Creates meaningful player archetypes
- ✅ Helps identify similar playing styles
- ✅ Reduces dimensionality for comparisons

**Impact**: Would improve comparison quality for all players

## **🎯 Best Practices for Missing Data**

### **1. Transparency**:
- Always indicate data quality (🟢🟡🔴)
- Show confidence in predictions
- Explain limitations clearly

### **2. Validation**:
- Cross-validate ML models
- Test predictions on known data
- Monitor model drift over time

- Use position averages when ML fails
- Provide multiple comparison methods
- Allow users to choose confidence levels

## **💡 Implementation Code Examples**

### **Enhanced Data Imputation**:
```python
from enhanced_data_imputation import EnhancedDataImputer

# Initialize imputer
imputer = EnhancedDataImputer(player_data)

# Calculate averages and train models
imputer.calculate_position_averages()
imputer.train_prediction_models()

# Enhance player data
enhanced_data = imputer.enhance_player_data()
```

### **Player Clustering**:
```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Prepare complete data
complete_data = player_data.players[complete_mask]
scaler = StandardScaler()
data_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(complete_data[features])

# Create clusters
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=8, random_state=42)
clusters = kmeans.fit_predict(data_scaled)

# Assign archetypes
complete_data['archetype'] = clusters
```

### **Confidence Scoring**:
```python
def calculate_confidence_score(player, predictions):
    """Calculate confidence in predictions"""
    available_stats = sum(1 for stat in stats if not pd.isna(player[stat]))
    prediction_count = len(predictions)
    
    # Higher confidence with more available data
    confidence = (available_stats + prediction_count) / len(stats)
    return min(confidence, 1.0)
```
